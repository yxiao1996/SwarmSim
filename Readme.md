## My Multi-Robot Simulation Environment
* ME740 Intelligent Mechanics Course Project 

This environment will implment three kinds of multi-robot control strategies on two kinds of dynamics.
Control strategy: virtual structure, behavior-based control, leader-follower control. 
Dynamics: differential drive dynamics, omni-directional dynamics. 

TODO:

1.add formation to behavior=-based control; 
2.try reinforcement learning on bahavior-based model;


### Introduction

There are two theoretical views on the control of multiple robot systems: centralized systems and decentralized systems. 

In a centralized system, a central unit is responsible for making decision for indivisuals and monitoring the accomplishment of the missoin. Communication only happen between central unit and indibisual, not between individuals. 

In a decentralized system, indivisuals can communicate with each other and share information. Each indiviual is responsible for a portion of the global mission. 

Virtual structure[2] is an exmample of control strategy for a centralized system, where a central unit is controling the motion of all robots in the system. 

Behavior-based strategy[3] is used for decentralized system. Each robot have an inner finite state machine. The states in the fsm correspond to different motor schemas. During running time, the robot switching among different motor schemas(through switching among states) to accomplish its individual goal. 

Leader-follower strategy[4][5] is a hybrid of centralized and decentralized systems. The leader is controlled by central unit, while the followers operate on there own using sensor data.
